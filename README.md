# Background

## Purpose

The Open Data Guidebook provides Ontario ministries and provincial agencies with information on Ontario&#39;s open data processes. It explains the requirements of Ontario&#39;s [Open Data Directive](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-open-data-directive) and provides guidance to ensure consistent approaches to open data practices across government.

The guidebook also provides direction on how to identify data, assess risks and prepare Open Data for publishing. It includes several resources, ideas for open data engagement, links to useful templates and answers to frequently asked questions.

## Open Data in Ontario

Ontario creates, collects and manages datasets covering a wide range of topics. We post many of these datasets as Open Data online in our [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc) for public access and use. These datasets are released as Open Data in accordance with Ontario&#39;s [Open Data Directive](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-open-data-directive) and under the [Open Government Licence - Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario) or a similar open licence.

The Open Data Directive came into effect on April 1, 2016, and a revised version August 6, 2019, and requires all data created, collected and/or managed by ministries and provincial agencies to be made public as open data, unless it is exempt for privacy, confidentiality, security, legal or commercially-sensitivereasons.

The Open Data Directive provides a strong foundation for delivering on the International Open Data Charter (IODC) principles in Ontario. However, there are still concrete steps to be taken to ensure a more robust implementation of the Open Data Directive.

Open Data is the approach through which government data is made available to the public, where appropriate, so that the public and businesses can repurpose the data to develop new ideas, services and applications.

For data to be &#39;Open Data&#39; it must satisfy the following three principles:

- **Open access**: free to download via the internet and should be easily accessible
- **Open format**: datasets should be machine-readable, platform independent, vendor neutral and standardized 
- **Open licence** : under a flexible use license that carries few conditions. It is suggested that Ontario Open Data be published under the [Open Government Licence – Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario). Ministries may use a similar open licence if the OGL is not appropriate

In May of 2017, Ontario became the first province in Canada to formally adopt the [International Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/) (IODC). The IODC was developed by open data experts from governments, multilateral organizations, civil society and private sector, working together to develop six principles for the release of data:

1. Open by Default;
2. Timely and Comprehensive;
3. Accessible and Useable;
4. Comparable and Interoperable;
5. For Improved Governance and Citizen Engagement; and
6. For Inclusive Development and Innovation.

Formal adoption of the IODC is an ongoing commitment that establishes international alignment, support and guidance for Ontario&#39;s Open Data. Open Government staff will continue to engage with the IODC staff and other jurisdictions who have adopted the charter to refine and improve our approach to Open Data. This Guidebook will be updated to reflect the new requirements/guidance for ministries to support the on-going adoption of the International Open Data Charter.

## Data Catalogue

On November 7, 2012, Ontario launched the Open Data Catalogue on Ontario.ca. In summer 2016, Ontario re-launched the catalogue as the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc), including ministry data inventories of all data, not just Open Data.

As part of its commitment to Open Government, the government committed to releasing new datasets in the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc) and directed ministries to develop strategies to support this commitment as part of their Open Government Plans.

The [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc) builds on established best practices and international conventions for making specific types of data open and available to the public through standard formats and a licence with very few restrictions.

# Responsibilities

## Summary

### Ministries and Provincial Agencies

1. Publish online all data that they create, collect and/or manage, unless the data cannot be public for privacy, confidentiality, security, legal or commercially-sensitive reasons.
 	 - ministries must publish their data on the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc)
	 - provincial agencies must publish their data on their own website (if they have one) or their responsible ministry&#39;s website (if the provincial agency does not have its own).
	  
2. Contribute and maintain a list of all datasets for which they have custody and control to Ontario&#39;s data inventory.
3. Ensure that Open Data requirements outlined in the ODD are built into their IT projects.
4. Ensure data is open by default by
  	- Doing everything possible to ensure the timely review and release of open data. Note that per revisions to the ODD effective August 6, 2019 Program Directors are responsible for ensuring a risk assessment was completed and approving the outcome (open or restricted). They are also responsible for briefing up when appropriate and coordinating the review of issues management plans when recommended by the risk review.
  	- Embedding open principles in data management activities, systems and processes
  	- Encouraging data literacy and open government objectives in learning and development plans of staff at all levels

### Ontario Digital Service, Cabinet Office

1. Coordinate and maintain an online inventory of all Government of Ontario datasets
2. Manage the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc) with respect to keeping it up to date and co-ordinating with ministries when new datasets are added.
3. Provide oversight for and report compliance with the Open Data Directive.

# Data Inventory

The [government-wide data inventory](https://www.ontario.ca/data/government-wide-data-inventory) was established in 2016 and keeping it current is an ongoing responsibility of Ontario&#39;s ministries and provincial agencies.

A data inventory is a list of datasets under the custody and control of the organization. Each ministry and provincial agency must create and maintain an inventory of their datasets.

The entire data inventory may be downloaded as an individual dataset. As new datasets are added or updated, coordinated by Open Government, the complete list of the current datasets in the inventory is also updated and posted as an Open Dataset in the catalogue.

Provincial Agencies are required to maintain their own individual data inventories hosted either on their own websites or the website of their responsible ministry.

## How to Identify Data

For the purposes of the Open Data Directive, data is defined as facts, figures, and statistics objectively measured according to a standard or scale, such as frequency, volumes or occurrences. Data does not include information like reports or manuals.

Although data is technically a form of information, it is important to distinguish data from information. The analysis of data can lead to the generation of other types of information. Ministries are encouraged to proactively release their information assets as Open Information and to explore connections between Open Data and Open Information.

As part of regular government operations, ministries and provincial agencies create, collect and/or manage different types of data.

- Corporate data – workforce characteristics, financial performance, asset characteristics, procurement
- Operational and program data – customer behaviour, program costs, service locations
- Policy and strategy data – market data, economic competitiveness, industry tracking, supply and demand projections
- Evaluation and performance data – program performance data, broader public sector service delivery reports, web traffic statistics

The following questions can help ministries and provincial agencies identify data:

1. **Does your organization have a legislative mandate to produce, collect or share data?**

	<ins>Example</ins>: <br>
	[Facilities Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summaries](https://www.ontario.ca/data/greenhouse-gas-emissions-reporting-facility): The Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change collects emissions data from regulated facilities for sources listed in Ontario Regulation 452/09.

2. **Does your organization use, maintain or own the datasets used to inform policy development or program delivery?**

	<ins>Example</ins>: <br>
	[Reports on Long Term Care Homes](http://publicreporting.ltchomes.net/en-ca/default.aspx): The Ministry of Health and Long term Care Homes inspection program ensures homes comply with provincially legislated standards. It uses the data that it collects to issue reports and create profiles for each home.

3. **Does your organization share statistics, tables, graphs or other visualizations with the public?**

	<ins>Example</ins>: <br>
	[Air Quality in Ontario Reports](http://www.airqualityontario.com/press/publications.php): The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change produces annual reports that use data that measure the amount of six common air pollutants as well as the results from the Air Quality Index and Smog Alert Programs. The data is visualized using charts and graphs in the Air Quality in Ontario Reports that are published on the ministry&#39;s website.

4. **Does your organization receive Freedom of Information (FOI) requests or other requests from stakeholders for datasets?**

	<ins>Example</ins>: <br>
	[Education Quality and Accountability Office Data Portal](http://www.eqao.com/en/research/data-portal): The Education Quality and Accountability Office makes some data available online to researchers. Researchers who require data not contained in the portal can submit a request to the Ministry of Education&#39;s Freedom of Information Office.

5. **Does your organization collect or manage data about stakeholders through surveys or consultations?**

	<ins>Example</ins>: <br>
	[The Health Care Experience Survey](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/news/bulletin/2012/hb_20121001_1.aspx): The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care conducts a telephone survey of Ontarians to understand Ontarians&#39; experience with obtaining health care in the province.

If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to any of these questions, your organization definitely possesses data and needs to list the data in the [data inventory](https://www.ontario.ca/data/government-wide-data-inventory).

Your organization may also already publish information that contains data, such as:

- tables of numbers (e.g., financial data, spending reports)

- graphs or pie charts (e.g., trends over time, demographic statistics)
- catalogues or lists of items (e.g., recipes, heritage properties)
- information collected and reported at regular intervals (e.g., wildlife population counts, vehicle accident statistics)
- mapped locations with supplementary information (e.g., hospitals, lakes, campsites)
- contact information (e.g., lists of addresses, hunting and fishing licence issuers)
- simple searchable databases (e.g., licensed childcare providers, approved driving schools)

The raw data that is included in information sources like the above must also be added to the inventory.

## Reasons for Exemption from Publication

Ministries and provincial agencies are required to release all data, unless it is exempt due to privacy, confidentiality, security, legal or commercial sensitivity reasons. However, data that is exempt from publication should still be listed in the [inventory](#_Contributing_to_the).

### Privacy – personal information

A dataset that contains any personal information about an individual must not be disclosed as Open Data under the [Open Government Licence – Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario). Indirect identifiers can also contain personal information. Ministries can receive assistance with this determination by contacting their [Freedom of Information and Privacy Coordinator](http://www.infogo.gov.on.ca/infogo/home.html#orgProfile/1803/en) (FOIP).

Examples of personal information can include (but are not limited to):

- race or colour
- national or ethnic origin
- religion
- age
- sex
- sexual orientation
- marital or family status
- medical, psychiatric, psychological, criminal or employment history
- name and contact information (does not apply to individuals acting in a business capacity)
- locations and times of specific individuals.

Organizations may still be able to release data that contains personal information by de-identifying the personal information in the dataset. This is a process that requires careful analysis and rigorous risk-assessment to avoid re-identification. Your FOIP coordinator will be able to help you assess the dataset.

### Security

A dataset may pose a security risk if released, by providing information about vulnerable or targeted individuals or organizations. Examples of these datasets may include:

- Information related to policing activities
- Information about vulnerable groups such as prison guards

### Legal and contractual limitations

A dataset may have legal or contractual agreements that prevent it from being released, such as:

- limitations in data sharing agreements
- third party data – organizations that collect data for a ministry or provincial agency to use, but which the ministry or provincial agency does not have the necessary rights to publish as Open Data
- commercial licence – data purchased from third parties (e.g. Canada Board of Trade) may have limited rights for distribution
- vendor limitations – external vendors&#39; data services delivered under a contract that forbids the extraction or manipulation of data.
- statute – some data is subject to statutory requirements
- commercial sensitivity – data that may be considered a trade secret

Your legal team will be able to help you assess the data to determine if there are other legal issues.

### Confidentiality

A dataset may breach confidentiality if its release impairs a government or court&#39;s ability to make decisions, such as:

- Court rulings or police investigation
- Budget and policy decisions that may impact financial markets
- Negotiations such as collective bargaining or international trade agreements

## Maintaining the Data Inventory

The process for maintaining the government-wide data inventory differs slightly for provincial agencies and ministries.

Provincial agency inventories are posted on their respective websites. They must follow their own publishing processes to ensure their inventory lists are accurate on an ongoing basis (at least annually) and notify their ministry of updates. Agencies are encouraged to provide links from their posted inventory to the Open Data Directive and the Data Catalogue.

Individual ministry datasets become part of the broader government-wide data inventory once published on the Data Catalogue. Ministries must review their entries on the catalogue at least annually to ensure that they are an accurate reflection of their data.

The following are key reasons to update the data inventory:

1. Changes to content.
2. The access level of datasets that were under review has changed (e.g. from &#39;under review&#39; to &#39;to be open&#39;).
3. There are new datasets to add to the inventory.
4. Errors (e.g. erroneously listing a dataset)

Minor changes to the data inventory (e.g. internal contact updates, typos and edits due to re-organization) do not need to be subject to the risk assessment process.

Major changes such as changing of access levels and adding new data elements to datasets should follow the data publishing process outlined below, to check for newly introduced risk. Ministries are encouraged to contact Open Government early in their update if they are unsure whether their update requires minor or major changes.

It is important to recognize that keeping the government-wide data inventory up to date is an on-going and collaborative process between ministries and Open Government.

An overview of the process and role/responsibilities is found in [Appendix 1](#Apendix1). In addition if you have multiple datasets to add the inventory, the [bulk upload template](https://intra.ontario.ca/wordpress/uploads/2017/03/Data-Inventory-bulk-template-wFrench-v1.xlsx) can be used.

# Open Data Publication

Any data that is not determined to be &#39;exempt&#39; for reasons described above, must be published in adherence to the principles outlined in section 4.0 of the [Open Data Directive](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-open-data-directive) (ODD).

Open Government has developed a process (described below) for ministries to assess risks and publish their data. Provincial agencies should consider the ministry requirements as an example of best practice and use them as a guide to develop their own internal publication process. As an additional final step in publication, provincial agencies should notify their responsible ministry when they have published data.

An overview of the process and roles/responsibilities is found in [Appendix 2](#Apendix2).

## Step 1: Identify, Describe and Prioritize Data

Once a dataset has been identified it should be described and added to the data inventory with an &#39;Under review&#39; status. In rare cases, the government cannot admit some data exists – this data should not be listed as part of the inventory.

The OG team is available to review draft dataset description forms before they are sent for translation to provide advice on the plain language and style to promote consistency with the broader catalogue.

Using their inventory as a guide, organizations are expected to focus their efforts and prioritize high-value datasets for release sooner.

There are several factors that can help you decide what data should be a priority for release:

- **High Value Data:**

	Data that is frequently requested by the public, or collected or produced in support of government priorities, mandated by act or statute, also released by other jurisdictions, or identified as high value by reputable international organizations, such as the Open Government Partnership or the Open Knowledge Foundation. See Appendix D of the [Open Data Directive](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-open-data-directive).

- **Public engagement and feedback:**

	Data is considered of high interest or value if it is the subject of a high number of public website searches, related webpage usage (e.g., similar datasets or info), relevant to public engagements, FOI requests or email/correspondence requests. Work with your web team, correspondence unit, call centres, program areas or FOIP coordinators to help determine what data the public would like opened.

- **Transparency &amp; accountability:**

	Data that increase transparency and accountability, specifically data used to create legislation, regulation, policy, program and service evaluation, or data related to asset management, procurement contracts and audited financial information (e.g., Public Accounts) is considered high-value.

- **Policy evaluation:**

	Releasing data that is useful for internal and external stakeholders&#39; evaluation of the delivery of policy, programs or services can be considered high-value. However, usefulness requires timely and frequent release to support effective evaluation.

- **Government Priority:**

	Data that aligns with new or important initiatives are considered high-value.

- **Program efficiency:**

	Data that can help improve the delivery of programs and services are considered high-value. To determine if data are of high-value to others, examine the inter-agency or inter-ministerial data requests (e.g., [Early Development Instrument](http://www.ontario.ca/data/early-development-among-children)).

- **Cost/return on investment:**

	Ministries and provincial agencies may want to prioritize data that will cost less to release, such as data that is already published or collected in a machine-readable format and will take less time and fewer resources to prepare as a result.

	Alternatively, data that has a large return-on-investment, such as data that can reduce FOI requests, create more efficient programs through research, or have positive economic or social impacts, should also be prioritized for release.

Given the prioritization criteria above, organizations must develop a plan, including timelines, for the publication of all datasets which are not deemed &#39;exempt&#39; according to the Open Data Directive.

Additionally, the Simpler, Faster, Better Services Act empowers the Chief Digital and Data Officer to identify and compel the release of high value data.

## Step 2: Assess Data

To determine whether data is eligible to be Open, the data must be assessed prior to publication for:

- legal, security, confidentiality, privacy and/or commercial-sensitivity issues
- issues management

Ministries are responsible for leading the assessment of their respective datasets. For corporate-wide or financial data, OG will work with the data custodians to assess the data.

Prior to publishing datasets that contain de-identified data, they should be assessed in the context of existing available data to manage the risk of identification through linking with existing data in the catalogue, or other similar datasets that are publicly available

A detailed list of teams that can be involved in assessments and how the data should be assessed can be found on the [Open Government intranet site](https://intra.ontario.ca/wordpress/uploads/2017/03/Dataset-Risk-Assessment-Considerations.docx). The following is an overview of roles that could be involved in the risk assessment process:

### Open Government Lead

The ministry Open Government lead should:

- identify their ministry&#39;s assessment team,
- convene the assessment team each time datasets need to be assessed, and determine timelines,
- document the results.

### Program/Policy Lead

The ministry program or policy lead (e.g., the data custodian or coordinator) should consider and document the dataset&#39;s content, any data quality issues, and update the release schedule.

Considerations when assessing data:

- whether the data can be interpreted by other people
- whether the data can be used to add value
- the limitations of the dataset
- similar data released in other jurisdictions
- the demand for and importance of a dataset as it may determine a dataset&#39;s economic or social impact potential.

### Legal Branch

Legal representatives can provide advice on the data&#39;s legal issues.

### Privacy Team

FOIP coordinators can assess whether the datasets contain [personal and/or confidential](#_Privacy_%E2%80%93_personal) information. They can also provide background on whether the dataset was included in an FOI request.

If the data contains personal information, they are required to make recommendations on whether it should be redacted, de-identified or exempt from publication.

The Information and Privacy Commissioner for Ontario has published [De-identification Guidelines for Structured Data](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Deidentification-Guidelines-for-Structured-Data.pdf). The guidelines introduce institutions to the basic concepts and techniques of de-identification, outline the key issues to consider when de-identifying personal information in the form of structured data and they provide a step-by-step process that institutions can follow when removing personal information from datasets.

### IT Cluster

Ministry IT clusters or ministry analytics branches can assess the data quality and accessibility and suggest how to extract the dataset in a machine-readable format.

### Communications Branch

Communications can help identify potential issues and opportunities associated with the release of the datasets. They can advise when issues management plans are needed and help develop appropriate plans.

### French Language Services Coordinator

Raw data is posted to the catalogue in the language in which it was created, but FLS coordinators can be consulted to ensure that language requirements under the French Language Services Act are met and will provide advice for identified datasets on French translation needs.

## Step 3: Prepare Data and Metadata

The following steps should be taken to prepare data for publication:

1. When recommended by Communications, write an issues management plan.
2. Convert data into an [Open Format](#DataFileFormats) with help from IT cluster as needed. Ensure that specific technical requirements are met and that the data is in a machine-readable format.
3. Update the [data description and metadata](https://intra.ontario.ca/wordpress/uploads/2017/03/Dataset-Description-Form-v1.xlsx) as needed. Review mandatory requirements using the [checklist](https://intra.ontario.ca/wordpress/uploads/2017/03/Dataset-Description-Form-Checklist.docx).
4. Check in with OG for advice on metadata updates. It is good practice to share a draft version of the data if possible as well, when seeking guidance on Open Formats.
5. Translate the metadata updates, the data dictionary, and other material for the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc). For greater clarity:
  	- Data files are published in the catalogue in the language in which they were collected. They are exempt from translation requirements.
  	- The dataset description, metadata, and accompanying data dictionaries or technical documentation must be translated. These will be separate documents that accompany the datasets. Any separate documents to accompany a dataset must also comply with AODA requirements.
  	- The ministry or affected program area is responsible for obtaining and covering the costs of translation.
6. Un-formatted data files that are structured for database consumption meet accessibility requirements. Formatted tables must pass Excel accessibility checks (e.g., no merged cells, alternative text, properly named columns and sheets, etc.)
7. If deem &#39;Restricted&#39; the rationale needs to be assessed for clarity and translated as part of the metadata.

## Step 4: Review Assessment

Before determining data as Open or Restricted the Program Director responsible must review the recommendations of the assessment team. This review will focus on the following key elements

- The data access level will be confirmed as &quot;Open&quot; or &quot;Restricted&quot;
- If &quot;Restricted&quot; the rationale not to release will be reviewed for clarity
- Any preparations of files to protect identity or mitigate other risks are reviewed and confirmed as appropriate
- If required, an associated issues management plan is reviewed by the Assistant Deputy Minister or delegate to confirm messaging and mitigation strategy is appropriate

Each dataset is unique and will require an assessment by multiple perspectives to ensure potential risks are mitigated. The director or delegate may ask that additional teams be engaged to review the assessment team&#39;s recommendations based on the nature of the dataset.

<img src="https://github.com/carolineyu0921/markdown/raw/master/TipImage.png" width="30" /> If data is already public outside of the catalogue no additional approvals are required to be added to the catalogue. Just create or update metadata as needed – your legal team should be consulted to update existing licensing to an Open licence when possible.

## Step 5: Submit Data and Metadata for Publishing

Once the recommendation of the assessment team is reviewed, the submission package is ready to be sent to the OGO.

The submission package to OGO must include:

- Either the data file, a link to the data file, or documentation required to access a database directly or the rationale not to release
- Updated data description form
- Documentation that the assessment was reviewed by Program Director
- If required, an issues management plan reviewed by the Assistant Deputy Minister&#39;s office

Before the dataset is updated to &#39;Open&#39; or &#39;Restricted&#39; the OGO will:

1. Assess the data and verify its compliance with the directive and the guidebook.
2. Share any associated issues management plan with strategic communications team to ensure the mitigation plan aligns with broader issues management strategies.

The OGO will work with the appropriate teams to publish the data and update the metadata in the Data Catalogue on Ontario.ca.

Once published, the OGO will send the relevant links to the ministry.

After publication, ministries should work with their Communications Branches and Cabinet Office to:

- promote through social media and traditional media in both English and French (e.g., links in News Releases).
- let their ministry and Ontario Public Service (OPS) colleagues know that they have published a new Open Dataset
- engage with partners

<img src="https://github.com/carolineyu0921/markdown/raw/master/TipImage.png" width="30" /> Check out the [Open Knowledge Foundation&#39;s guide](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/following-up/) for more ideas on what you can do next.

# Managing Published Data

## Dataset Maintenance

All published datasets must be updated and maintained as applicable.

Routine or minor updates (e.g. correcting errors or typos) to ministry datasets do not have to go through the entire publishing process. However, major structural changes (such as the addition or removal of data elements) to the data must go through a new assessment to ensure no new risks have been introduced.

### Minor Updates

To update the dataset:

- Update the data file according to your internal process if the dataset is hosted on your own website and notify OG.
- Send the updated file to OG if the data is hosted on the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc) on Ontario.ca.

For data published as an application (APIs), major changes should be documented in technical documentation hosted on the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc).

In situations where active maintenance and updates of a dataset are discontinued, or where any published dataset must be replaced with a newer or modified version, the dataset description should be updated in the catalogue to reflect the &quot;inactive&quot; status, _without_ restricting public access to the dataset.

Where custody and control for a dataset is transferred from one program area to another program area, the new program area must update the dataset description in the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc) to reflect this.

### Major Updates

Major changes such as the inclusion of a new data element and publishing new data in the Data Catalogue must follow the data risk assessment and publishing process. Ministries are encouraged to contact the OGO early in their update if they are unsure whether their update is minor or major.

## Dataset Removal

Datasets released as Open Data should not be deleted or removed from public access, except where a dataset is published in error.

If you need to remove a dataset from the Data Catalogue, the following steps must be taken:

1. Document the reason for requesting the removal of the dataset from the catalogue in a briefing note that is approved by your Deputy Minister.
2. Submit the request to remove the dataset, along with a rationale for the removal and links to remaining related datasets to OG.
3. OG will work with the appropriate teams to remove and record the dataset.
4. OG will maintain a public inventory of removed datasets and their reasons for removal.

# Procurement and Contracts

Publishing procurement award data helps make procurement processes more transparent and clarifies government decision-making. Wherever possible, procurement award information should be reviewed for proactive release. In fact, the OPS Procurement Directive requires ministries to post contract award notifications for competitive procurement processes valued at $25,000 or more for goods and $100,000 or more for services.

In support of open data, the Ontario Government publishes various procurement datasets on Ontario&#39;s Open Government Catalogue including but not limited to:

- enterprise-wide VOR arrangements planned for the next three years by Supply Chain Ontario (SCO)
- enterprise-wide VOR arrangements

## Data as Output of Procurement Contracts

The Open Data Directive has requirements for all procurement awards.

The Request for Bids Terms and Conditions template posted on the [Supply Chain Ontario Tools and Template ](http://intra.ops.myops.gov.on.ca/cms/tiles.nsf/(vwReadPagesByRefId_Content)/scm2006.12.18.13.17.42.PG4_page?open)webpage under &quot;Procurement Documents&quot; includes a clause that informs vendors that your ministry may publish specific procurement award data collected from vendor(s).

Ministries not using the Request for Bids template are required to work with their procurement and legal teams to develop and include necessary clauses in new contract agreements that will permit government to publish data collected.

Ministries must consult their Open Government Lead, Privacy Coordinator and legal team when considering a potential exemption to disclosing a procurement record.

## Data and Transfer Payments

With respect to transfer payments (TP), ministries and provincial agencies are subject to the requirements outlined in the Transfer Payment Accountability Directive. The scope of the ODD does not extend to transfer payment recipients, and as such they are not required to publish data produced as a result of transfer payment funding.

However, ministries and provincial agencies are required to have a legal agreement in place with each TP recipient that includes a requirement for recipients to report on the progress towards implementing performance measures and achieving the outputs and/or outcomes of the activity. The government may publish any data that is collected through oversight, monitoring and reporting, including reporting on performance measures that are set out in the TP agreement for ongoing and time-limited TPs.

## I&amp;IT Requirements

The directive has implications for I&amp;IT solutions and processes, including procurement and internal builds. Program areas should work with their I&amp;IT cluster and/or procurement advisors to ensure:

- Any new I&amp;IT data management platforms/solutions/applications, whether a new build or the purchase of an off-the-shelf product, are designed to allow for the extraction of data in an open format, making it easier to publish and regularly maintain data in the [Data Catalogue](http://www.ontario.ca/open-data).
- The architecture review process confirms that open data requirements are included in any solution, such that any data your system manages could be easily extracted in an Open Format to publish in the Data catalogue.
- I&amp;IT solutions require proactive consideration of privacy protection throughout the lifecycle of the data. For more details, see the [Corporate Policy on the Protection of Personal Information](http://intra.ops.myops.gov.on.ca/cms/tiles.nsf/(vwReadResourcesByRefId_Content)/cpd2011.06.22.14.34.06.PSD_res/%24File/CorporatelPolicyPersonalInformationProtection.pdf).

Best practices for extracting data include:

1. Providing a linked, rich API over HTTPS in an open format through an API, and publishing the URL to the API in the [Data Catalogue](http://www.ontario.ca/open-data). The URL should use https to ensure the privacy of the user.
2. Providing a real-time or snapshot view of a particular dataset at a URL.
3. A periodic, automatic report that produces an open format suitable for upload to the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc).

# Reporting and Compliance

Ministries and provincial agencies must comply with the requirements of the Open Data Directive. Reviewing and understanding the specific roles and responsibilities in the directive can help maintain compliance.

The ministry or provincial agency is responsible for implementing the directive in their organization. This plan should include accountabilities for ministry and provincial agency staff, and identify contacts for staff to obtain information, advice and direction on potential datasets from the public.

## Ministries

By signing the existing annual Certificate of Assurance Attestation at the end of each fiscal year, Deputy Ministers assure that their ministry and all provincial agencies are compliant with all corporate directives and policies, including the Open Data Directive.

## Provincial Agencies

As set out in the Agencies and Appointments Directive, Chairs of board-governed provincial agencies must confirm their agency&#39;s compliance with legislation, directives, and accounting and financial policies in a letter to their minister.

Mandatory requirements of the directive will be built into the annual attestation signed by the CEOs.

The letter submitted by the Chair to the minister will be used by the Deputy Minister to provide assurance of the provincial agency&#39;s compliance.

In addition to the annual compliance processes, OG will conduct an annual review of ministry compliance with the directive through the performance measurement processes and review status against ministry plans. This review includes:

- ministry compliance: percentage of datasets released from the OPS Inventory into the [Data Catalogue](http://www.ontario.ca/open-data)
- OPS participation: percentage of eligible ministries publishing data into the [Data Catalogue](http://www.ontario.ca/open-data)
- user uptake: increase in web traffic and downloads from the [Data Catalogue](http://www.ontario.ca/open-data)
- overall user satisfaction with released data.

Open Government will lead the coordination, consolidation and reporting of all compliance and performance measures information when reporting to the public.

# Open Data Engagement

Publishing Open Data is not just about technology, standards, or process. A key component is engaging with both English and French-speaking data users and the community of data custodians, enthusiasts, and policy makers to ensure the data can be accessed and used effectively.

An Open Data Engagement Plan should be developed by each ministy and provincial agency to promote and communicate the value and benefits of open data. If your Open Data Engagement plan includes hosting data visualization tools on your own or a third party website, best practice is that the website would include a link back to the original dataset in the [Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc).

For more information on how to participate in open data events and communities interested in open data, contact your minitry&#39;s [OG Support Team](https://intra.ontario.ca/tbs/resources-3) members. Here are some tips and guiding questions to help facilitate engagement with open data. They are designed to provoke thought and action.

1. Work within the Ontario Public Service, Broader Public Service and with the public and stakeholders to assist in identifying and prioritizing the release of datasets at the community, regional and provincial levels to support social research and planning.

	- Are your choices about the data you release, the structure of the data, and the tools and support provided with it based on community needs and demands?
	- Do you have ways of listening to people&#39;s requests for data, and responding with open data?
	- What was the ranking of your datasets on the voting tool?

2. Work with industry stakeholders to raise awareness of the economic potential of open data and to prioritize the release of Datasets to support economic activities.

	- Who are the key users of the data?
	- How are they using the data?
	- Do you have a sense of the benefits they are deriving from using Ontario&#39;s data?

3. Promote data literacy within educational programs and tools in ministries/provincial agencies under the guidance of OG.

	- Are you aware of initiatives and courses to build skills with data analyses and literacy?
	- Do you provide open data analysis tools and guidance on using the tools?
	- Do you promote, enable and create capacity to help ministry staff and the community work with open data?

4. Promote the use of government data and digital applications and services with stakeholders.

	- Once published, do you promote your datasets using a variety of external and internal communications channels?
	- Who would be interested in knowing about and having access to your data?
	- Are you aware of any digital applications that have been developed with the types of datasets you manage?

5. Evaluate the potential of sharing the data internally and/or with relevant external organizations in secure environments whenever government data cannot be broadly shared as Open Data.

	- For datasets that cannot be relased as Open Data, are there opportunities to share with others within the OPS?
	- Are you aware of Statistics Canada Research Data Centres? Are there opportunities to work with them?

6. OG will coordinate with stakeholders and other levels of government to increase the interoperability and relevance of data. This includes collecting community input, feedback and improving Open Data quality standards.

	- Can people comment on datasets, or create a structured conversation regarding data to network with other data users?
	- Do you know where the conversations are happening? Do you join the conversations?
	- Do you have feedback loops so people can help you improve your datasets?
	- Do you collaborate with the community to create new data resources (e.g. derived datasets)?

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Background

1. **What is Open Data?**

	Open Data is data that is released to the public without charge, under an open licence, through the Ontario Data Catalogue. There are many benefits of launching an open data program, including:

	- Stimulating Economic Growth
	- Improving government service delivery
	- Improving public accountability and transparency


2. **What is the Open Data Directive?**

	The Open Data Directive became effective April 1, 2016, with revisions effective August 6, 2019, and outlines key principles and requirements for publishing Open Data. It applies to data created and managed by Ontario ministries and provincial agencies.

	The directive aims to maximize access to government data by requiring all data to be made public, unless it is exempted for privacy, confidentiality, security, legal or commercial sensitivity reasons.

	The directive also requires a public inventory of all OPS and provincial agency data assets and requires future IT investments and procurement contracts to consider open data requirements.

3. **To whom does the directive apply?**

	The Open Data Directive applies to Ontario ministries and provincial agencies.

	The directive does not apply to broader public sector organizations. We continue to work with the broader public sector to improve access to their data by sharing best practices.

4. **How do I know if my organization is a provincial agency required to follow the Directive?**

	If you are a provincial agency, you are required to comply with the Directive. The [Agencies and Appointments Directive](http://intra.ops.myops.gov.on.ca/cms/tiles.nsf/(vwReadResourcesByRefId_Content)/cpd2015.01.30.12.43.41.NSU_res/%24File/Agencies_Appointments_Directive.pdf) can help you determine if you are a provincial agency. It defines the characteristics of a provincial agency as follows:

	- Is established by government through a constituting instrument (under or by statue, Order in Council or regulation);
	- Is accountable to a minister for fulfilling its legislative obligations, the management of resources it uses, and its standards for any services it provides;
	- The majority of its appointments are made by the government;
	- Is not organizationally part of a ministry but is part of the Government of Ontario;
	- Has authority and responsibility, granted by the government, to perform an ongoing public function or service that involves adjudicative or regulatory decision-making, operational activity, or an advisory function.

	You can also check the [provincial agencies list](http://intra.ops.myops.gov.on.ca/cms/tiles.nsf/(vwReadResourcesByRefId_Content)/cpd2008.04.01.08.18.40.GFQ_res/%24File/listClassifiedAgencies.pdf) for your organization.

5. **What is the International Open Data Charter?**

	The [International Open Data Charter](http://opendatacharter.net/) is a set of six principles developed through collaboration between governments and civil society members. Jurisdictions that adopt the IODC agree to follow the six principles that will be the foundation for access to data and for the release and use of data. These principles mandate that data should be:

	- Open by default
	- Timely and comprehensive
	- Accessible and usable
	- Comparable and interoperable
	- For improved governance and citizen engagement
	- For inclusive development and innovation

6. **How does the directive fit into the Engagement Team&#39;s recommendations on open data?**

	The province appointed an Open Government Engagement Team made up of public engagement and digital experts. This team travelled across the province, used a variety of social media tools and traditional media to gather feedback from the public, and spark new conversations about how government can engage, innovate and collaborate.

	One of the Engagement Team&#39;s recommendations was to implement an Open by Default Data Policy. The Open Data Directive is the government&#39;s response to this recommendation.

7. **How do I know which (if any) of my data should be exempt?**

	The directive requires all government data to be made public, unless there is privacy, confidentiality, security, legal or commercially sensitive reasons not to release it. This means that Ontario will not publish data that:

	- contains personal or confidential information
	- has legal, copyright or security restrictions, or
	- compromises public safety.

	We know releasing government and provincial agency data is the right thing to do. It&#39;s also the smart thing. We will work with our partners to ensure they understand the principles and benefits of open data, and follow their obligations through the directive.

8. **My ministry/provincial agency is worried about resource implications to support the implementation of the directive.**

	OG and ministry leads will support ministries in implementing the directive and providing assistance as required. Ministries and provincial agencies are expected to:

	- prioritize the release of datasets that address government priorities or have been requested by the public
	- optimize resources to focus on high demand datasets
	- develop business cases in instances where additional funding is required

## Data Inventory

1. **What is the definition of data?**

	Data is defined in the directive as facts, figures and statistics objectively mea­sured according to a standard or scale, such as frequency, volumes or occurrences.

2. **To what data does the Directive apply?**

	The Open Data Directive applies to all data created, collected, or managed by ministries and provincial agencies.

3. **How often does the inventory need to be reviewed?**

	Ministries and provincial agencies need to review and update their inventory at least annually to ensure it is complete and current. Ministries will work with OGO to make updates following the data publishing process. Provincial agencies should notify their ministries when updates are made to ensure messaging and communication efforts are coordinated.

4. **Do I need to list every dataset in my inventory?**

	Yes, ministries and provincial agencies must list all datasets in their inventory. The only exception is that ministries may omit datasets where: &quot;the organization is prevented from disclosing the Data by law or it is authorized by law to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of Data&quot;.

## Open Data Publication

1. **Do I have to publish the data for every dataset listed in the inventory?**

	Some datasets cannot be published due to privacy, security, confidentiality, legal or commercially sensitive reasons. However, these datasets must still be listed in the inventory along with the explanation of why they cannot be published.

	All other listed datasets should be published as Open Data.

2. **Why might a dataset not be published as Open Data?**

	The directive specifically exempts data for the following reasons:

	- data is subject to statutory confidentiality requirements
	- data should not be disclosed for legal, security, confidentiality, privacy or commercially sensitive reasons.

	For assistance, please contact your [Freedom of Information and Privacy Unit](http://www.infogo.gov.on.ca/infogo/office.do?actionType=telephonedirectory&amp;infoType=telephone&amp;unitId=1803&amp;locale=en), legal team or OG

3. **What if there is an error in the data published?**

	The OG team is available to help update incorrect data. Depending on the nature of the error you may be advised to loop in communications or other ministry teams. Sometimes these data corrections can be opportunities to highlight the value of opening data and building trust i.e. error was caught by public – correction can be made and a &#39;thank you for making our data better&#39; tweet could be sent with a link to the updated data.

	In addition, if there is a significant error the dataset may need to go through the risk assessment process before publishing.

4. **What do I do if the public requests a dataset that has not been published as open?**

	Requests for data are important to the identification and prioritization of high value data. Work with the assessment team, especially communications to:

	- Provide an interim response.
	- Assess the status (i.e. whether it will be made open, restricted, etc.)
	- Prioritize for release if possible.
	- Post
	- Follow up with the requester that it has been posted, or if the data are restricted share the rationale and point them to any available related data.

	If there is a lot of interest in restricted data you may want to assess if any aggregation or de-identification can be performed to make some data available.

5. **How can I see unpublished datasets?**

	Ministries are responsible for prioritizing and categorizing datasets for publication.

	Ministries are required to have a timeline for completing the review of datasets currently listed as &#39;under review&#39; and should provide that anticipated date.

	Ministries are required to be &quot;open by default&quot;, so feedback and requests from the public should be used to prioritize release of Open Data.

	Ministries should anticipate that members of the public could submit Freedom of Information requests for datasets not released as Open Data and be prepared to release the data unless it falls under one of the exclusions or exemptions in FIPPA.

6. **Does all data need to be published in English and French?**

	Open Data is to be published in the Data Catalogue in the language in which it was collected. The dataset title, description, and all accompanying information must be available simultaneously in both English and French using the [Dataset Description Form](https://intra.ontario.ca/wordpress/uploads/2017/03/Dataset-Description-Form-v1.xlsx). The name/title and description in the public-facing data inventory must be available in both official languages.

	In addition, the ministry and provincial agency responsible for the data should consult with their French Language Services Coordinator in order to review datasets and discuss French translation needs. Although most raw datasets and numerical data do not require translation, the title, description, metadata, data dictionaries and accompanying technical documentation must be translated in order to comply with the posting requirements.

7. **Can you give me some examples of high-value datasets that you have opened? What do you mean by high-value?**

	Ontario&#39;s datasets cover many subjects, from transportation to the environment, and include a number of high-value datasets. High-value datasets are deemed to be those that are:

	- frequently requested by the public via Freedom of Information requests, public surveys, phone, mail inquiries, and media
	- collected or produced in support of government priorities
	- legislative mandate to produce, collect or share data, or
	- identified as such by reputable international organizations, such as the Open Government Partnership or the Open Knowledge Foundation.

	Some of Ontario&#39;s high value datasets include:

	- [University and College enrollment](https://www.ontario.ca/data/college-enrolment)
	- [Personal income tax rates and credits](https://www.ontario.ca/data/personal-income-tax-rates-and-credits)

	- [Traffic volume on provincial highways](https://www.ontario.ca/data/traffic-volume)
	- [Employment Service Program information and outcomes](https://www.ontario.ca/data/employment-service)
	- [Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions for the Broader Public Sector](https://www.ontario.ca/data/energy-use-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-broader-public-sector)
	- [Hospital Locations](https://www.ontario.ca/data/hospital-locations)

8. **What formats are used to publish these datasets?**

	Ontario&#39;s datasets are made available in machine-readable formats (formats that computers and other types of technology can easily process). Formats include

	- XML (extensible markup language)
	- CSV (comma-separated values)
	- TXT (text) files

	Depending on the data, other formats may be available.

## Managing Published Data

1. **What happens if I publish a dataset in error?**

	There may be exceptional circumstances that require datasets to be removed from the catalogue. Contact OG to discuss options for correcting errors.

## I &amp; IT Projects

1. **What do I need to know about open data requirements when planning an I&amp;IT project?**

	If your I&amp;IT solution incorporates data management, one of the requirements must be that it can extract datasets into an Open Format.

	The gold standard as identified in the Directive is to provide the data online through an API, and publishing the URL to the API in the [Ontario Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc).

	Other approaches to satisfy this requirement could include a button that an admin clicks to generate a machine-readable report, or having the system periodically email a report to the program area.

	Projects should ensure these requirements are built into their Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and contracts with vendors; or are available from off-the-shelf solutions.

	Submissions to the Architecture Review Board (ARB), cluster governance, as well as TB/MBC and ITPAC submissions should highlight how the requirements of the Open Data Directive will be met.

	All digital projects that are either public-facing or budgeted over $1m are required to undergo a [Digital First Assessment](https://intra.ontario.ca/ops/digital-first-assessments-meeting-ontarios-digital-service-standard). The assessment questions focus on a project&#39;s alignment to the 14 points of Ontario&#39;s Digital Service Standard. One of the 14 points is &quot;open standards and common platforms&quot;. To ensure a smooth assessment, make sure to design open data in to your system early on.

2. **What if I procure a solution instead of building it?**

	Procured data management platforms are also required to support open data requirements.

3. **Which I&amp;IT solutions are subject to the Open Data Directive? What is meant by data management solution vs. all IT solutions?**

	In general, transactional systems include data and therefore should have open data export functionality built in. Keep in mind that most transactional systems will include direct or indirect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which will not be eligible for publishing on the [Ontario Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc). Where possible, such systems should be designed in a way to facilitate publishing those portions of the data that does not contain PII. For example, a database of room reservations might publish the list of rooms but not the reservations themselves.

	When it comes to computer logs, it is not the intention of the directive to include all computer logs generated by all systems in the definition of data. However, if the specific character of a log meets the definition of data, it should be included in the inventory. For instance, it does not make sense to publish the system log of every computer in the organization. On the other hand, website analytics data such as page views is a dataset and is used to inform communication planning, and should be published.

## Reporting and Compliance

1. **How do I ensure my ministry/provincial agency is in compliance with the directive?**

	Ensure that your ministry/provincial agency follows the mandatory requirements of the directive and the review and publishing steps outlined in the _Publishing Data_ Section.

	OG will play an oversight role by conducting an annual review of compliance with the mandatory requirements of the directive. Ministries will leverage the certificate of assurance process that assures ministries are in compliance with all corporate directives and policies while provincial agencies require attestations of compliance from board governed Chair/CEO.

## Where to Go for Help

1. **How do I find out who my Open Government Lead is in my ministry?**

	Each ministry has appointed an Open Government Executive Lead. You can find out who your lead is on the [Open Government intranet](https://intra.ontario.ca/tbs/ministry-open-government-leads) site.

2. **Where can provincial agency staff go to find help?**

	Staff at provincial agencies can find additional resources on AGNES or by contacting their lead ministry.

3. **Will staff be trained on open data requirements?**

	A wide range of Open Government tools, resources and training – including courses on open data – will be offered to staff to help build skillsets and capacity in this area.

4. **Who can I contact if I have more questions about the directive?**

	The OGO is happy to provide assistance. You can email [opendata@ontario.ca](mailto:opendata@ontario.ca) or refer to our contact list at the Ministry Support Teams on the Open Government intranet site.

## 2. Open Data File Formats

Open datasets are formatted as non-proprietary, open files to promote broad use and ensure compatibility when working with other sources. Data formats must be:

1. **Platform-independent** <br>
The file should not be tied to a particular computer vendor.    
   *  Example: A numbers spreadsheet is only viewable on Apple devices and should be avoided in favour of CSV, which is viewable on any platform.
2. **Machine-readable** <br>
The file format should be suitable for machine processing.
	- Example:  A table in PDF format is intended for a human viewer, not a machine. The underlying table should instead be published in a suitable format for tabular data, such as CSV.

3. **Vendor-neutral** <br>
The file format should not require proprietary software to view.
	- Example: A Microsoft Access MDB file requires Microsoft Access to view. Data should be released as CSV or open database formats such as MySQL SQL files.

4. **Standardized** (where possible) <br>
Certain data types have actual or de facto standards adopted by their communities. Data owners should strive to use these standards where available.
	- Example: Transit data is almost universally released in GTFS. This is preferable to custom formats as it will allow easier integration of Ontario data with existing tools.

<ins>Table 2</ins>: File formats that are not encouraged and do not meet all of the requirements of Open file formats.

| FILE FORMAT| DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| **XLS** | XLS is a file format used with Microsoft Excel. Main spreadsheet format which holds data in charts, worksheets and macros.<ul><li>Data can be transferred into a CSV/TXT format.</li></ul> |
 **Microsoft Access file types (MDB, MDA, ACCDB)** | Microsoft Office Access is a pseudo-database management system that can combine data from other file formats such as XLS, SharePoint lists, text, XML, etc. to compile in a single database.<ul><li>The end result of this database file should be converted to a CSV/TXT or another machine-readable format.</li></ul>|
| **ZIP** | Zip files are compressed files or folders. Zip files are not encouraged within an Open Data setting, unless necessary (a skin, blog theme) since files included are uncontrolled types.<ul><li>Supported by all operating systems Windows 98 and later, and Mac OS X 10.3 and later.</li></ul>|
| **Daisy** | Daisy is a Java/XML open-source content management system and is in use at major corporations and governments for intranet knowledge bases, project documentation and management of content-rich websites. This content is stored in so-called Daisy documents.<ul><li>Uses a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing environment, and is a front-end application. This is not a back-end machine-readable format.</li></ul>|
| **HTML/HTM** | HTML (hypertext markup language) is the predominant markup language for web pages. Alone, it is not optimized for machine-readability, but only the output is meant for human readability.<ul><li>Although some HTML files (depending on the site&#39;s usage) can be converted to XML or XHTML to be machine-readable, this does not mean _all_ HTML files can be converted. For this difficulty in defining and determining (by the average user) which files are good for conversion and which ones are not, HTML should not be an acceptable file format.</li></ul>|


<ins>Table 3</ins>: File formats that should not be used.

| FILE FORMAT | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| **DOC** | DOC files are files and documents that are created by word processing software. Data contained in this type of file should be analyzed to determine which file format to save it in for inclusion within the data catalogue. |
| **Media files (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, MP3, AVI, etc.)** | Media files should not be included into the database since it does not provide actual source data. Even if the JPG may be a chart or graph, or if the MP3 is of a recent podcast that discusses data –these are not good formats because data cannot be extracted at all. |
| **EXE** | An executable file is essentially a full program. This file type should not be released at all. |
| **JS, PHP, ASP, ASPX, PLS, VBS** | These files are scripting languages that are used to create dynamic content or functions on web pages. This type of file does not carry any type of actual raw data and should not be included in an open data database. |
